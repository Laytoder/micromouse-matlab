# Code For a Maze-Solving robot in MatLab (Class Project in Arizona State University's FSE 100)

Inspiration behind the project:

The project is inspired by the idea of creating an ***Automted Transporation Service*** for the ***disabled*** and ***elderly*** with the usage of Self-Driving 
technology.

This project is a very basic demonstration of it intended to introducing students to the thinking and brainstorming process involved with engineering.

Specifications of the robot:

1. The robot navigates from a start to an end point in a maze.

2. The robot has a build in automatic lifting mechanism which picks up a cardboard chair. (Simulating the process of lifting old or handicapped people.)

3. The robot follows basic traffic signal by stopping at Red Lights and Yellow Lights. It only begins moving when the light turns Green.

4. The robot is build using lego parts and uses an EV3 Brick to control motors and sensors.

5. Basic Light Sensors and Ultrasonic Sensors are used in the project.
